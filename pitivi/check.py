"""
This file is run by bin/pitivi on startup. Its purpose is to ensure that all
the important dependencies for running the pitivi UI can be imported and satisfy
our version number requirements.

The checks here are supposed to take a negligible amount of time (< 0.2 seconds)
and not impact startup. Module imports have no impact (they get imported later
by the app anyway). For more complex checks, you can measure (with time.time()),
when called from application.py instead of bin/pitivi, if it has an impact.
