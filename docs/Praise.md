# On our IRC channel/elsewhere

-   **P Fudd**: Thanks again for a great program! I managed to edit my
    file correctly in the first 5 minutes of using Pitivi, which is far
    faster than I managed with any other program! (2014 03 14 on
    bug 719651)
-   **Jonathan Duff**: I just want to say also I was blown away by how
    intuitive, versatile (by using GStreamer), and powerful this program
    is. I'm used to using Adobe Premiere Pro, so I was very impressed
    when I found this gem. (2010 12 31 at 21h55 UTC)
-   **rowinggolfer**: Loving the git version. You guys are awesome. I
    was a Pitivi skeptic until a couple of weeks ago, but I am using it
    daily to get stuff done with very few issues and a tiny learning
    curve (2010 02 21 at 13h15 GMT -5)
-   **Ants**: \[...\] Might I say, 0.14 has blown me away, it's
    fantastic! \[...\] (2011 06 05 on LP \#709090)

# Ubuntu Software Center reviews

## Version 0.15

-   “Works like a charm”:\
    Had to do some editing, was quick and simple. (Paulius Šukys,
    2014-03-03)
-   “Great little application for quick video editing”:\
    If you want to do some quick and simple video editing and exporting
    then this is a great app for that. Do not expect it to do the world.
    (Iain Lane, 2011-11-02)
-   “Must Have Video Editor!”:\
    Gotta be one of the best I've used! It's definitely gotten WORLDS
    better than it used to be. (Yanike, 2011-12-14)
-   “My Favorite Video Editor on Ubuntu”:\
    I know that OpenShot seems to get a lot more attention as a video
    editor on Ubuntu, but I find Pitivi to be the better software. For
    example, I find making the actual cuts, more instinctual on Pitivi,
    and I'm able to be more precise - It earns a lot of points for that.
    \[...\] if you really want to do some efficient editing, I say go
    with Pitivi. It gets my vote. (DigitalMan, 2011-11-27)
-   “Better than Ever”:\
    What else can I say? UI is good, effects are nice and it handles big
    files (2 GB) without crashing. It took a while, but now Pitivi is
    finally usable editor with potential! (PYHhfWp, 2011-10-31)
-   “Getting there”:\
    It has taken a while, but as of version 0.15.0, Pitivi is both
    stable for me and presents a sufficient featureset to be useful.
    Compared to other video editors, I find the UI a pleasure to use.
    However, it's about time the still missing features (titling and
    more complex transitions) are implemented. (Alexander Hunziker,
    2011-09-29)
