# Crossplatform

Pitivi's dependencies are cross-platform, so in theory it should be
easy to bundle the app and the libs and ship it.

The plan is to use GStreamer's Cerbero build system for building.
Then some Windows installer-maker and some Mac DMG-maker would
complete the picture.

There will probably be many bugs to fix, but it should worth the time,
to get more exposure.
