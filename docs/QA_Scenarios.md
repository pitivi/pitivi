These QA Scenarios are here to check the expected behaviours of Pitivi
under many situations.

If you see a problem in one of them, [Create a
task](Bug_reporting.md) on Phabricator, indicating:

-   which QA Scenario doesn't go through,
-   (optionally) the media files you used,
-   At which step it failed and what happened
-   Which version of Pitivi was used

# Standard QA Scenarios

## Test Import

1.  Start Pitivi
    -   Pitivi should appear
2.  Choose Import from Toolbar

4.  Select one clip in the file browser and press the “insert” key
    -   the clip should be inserted at the end of the timeline
5.  Select two files (using shift- or control-click) and press the “insert” key
    -   Both clips are inserted at end of timeline in the order in which they are sorted in the clip browser.
6.  Drag and drop one file from the clip browser to the timeline

    -   Pitivi should remove the clips from the timeline
9.  Move the pointer back inside the timeline area
    -   The clips should re-appear as they were before being removed
10. Release the mouse within the timeline.
    -   Make sure the clips are added at the mouse position.
11. Repeat steps 8 and 9, then release the mouse button outside the timeline
    -   Make sure that no clips are added to the timeline
12. Add several instances of a factory to the timeline
13. Choose Project &gt; “Remove from Project” to remove the clip from the timeline
    -   Make sure every instance of the factory is removed from the timeline.


## Test Preview

1. Start with at least two clips in the timeline.
2. Press 'Play/Pause' button on the viewer.
    - Playback button icon should change from 'Play' to 'Paused'
    - Watch the preview output carefully. There should be no glitche
    - When the playhead crosses clip boundaries, playback should remain smooth
    - When the playhead moves off-screen, the timeline should scroll to center the playhead in the window.
3. Press the 'Play/Pause' button on the viewer again.
    - Playback should immediately cease.
4. Scroll the timeline so that the playhead moves off screen (increase zoom level if necessary)
    -   The timeline scroll position should not jitter, nor snap back to the playhead while the playhead is paused.
5. Repeat (2) - (4), using the keyboard shortcuts
6. Repeat (2) - (4) alternating alternating between using the playback button and the keyboard shortcuts.
    -   In particular, make sure the icon on the play/pause button is updated properly.
7. Click and drag on the volume curve on one of the clips. Move it to just above the bottom of the clip.
8. Play that portion of the clip
    - The volume should sound softer

## Test Audio-Only Clips

-   add at least one video track to timeline
-   add and audio clip to the timeline

## Test Still Images

## Test Ruler

1. Start with at least one clip in the Timeline
2. click on the timeline ruler.
    - The timeline playhead marker should appear under the mouse pointer
    - The viewer should display the timeline at the timestamp represented by the playhead
3. Scrub the mouse over the ruler
    - The playhead should track the mouse position closely
    - The viewer should update continuously while the mouse is moving

## Test Clips

1. Start with at least two clips in the timeline
2. Click and drag the middle of one of the clips.
   -   the trimming handles at the start and end of the clips should highlight as the mouse moves over them
   -   the clip should move smoothly, even when vigorously scrubbed back and forth
   -   the viewer should not update during this operation **this will change when we support live previews**
   -   if thumbnails are enabled, they should appear properly even while the clip is being moved
   -   the clip should snap to the edges of other clips, but not to its original coordinates
   -   check that audio track moves downward so that tracks do not intermingle
   -   when moved beyond the edges of the timeline window, the timeline should scroll
   -   when moving leftward from the right edge (end) of the timeline, there should be no change in scroll position unless the clip moves past the left edge of the timeline.
   -   you should not be able to move the start of the clip past the beginning of the timeline
   -   at all times the shaded portion of the timeline ruler should show the true length of the entire timeline.                                                               |
3. Click and drag the middle of one of the clips in the top-most, moving it up and down.
   -   The layer position of the clip in the track should change
   -   The track containing the clip should expand (pushing all clips lower tracks downward).
   -   The vertical position of layers and controls adjacent to the timeline should update to match                                                                            |

       -   You should not be able to expand the clip beyond its native duration
       -   You should not be able to move the handle beyond the right edge of the clip
   -   When the start keyframe of an audio clip moves out of view, a “remote handle” should appear matching its vertical position.                                             |
5. Repeat step (4) for the right handle of the same clip
6. Double click on the volume curve on one of the audio clips (preferably one with start &gt; 0)
    A new key frame control point should appear under the mouse location
7. Click and drag the key frame

## Test Roll Editing

1. Start with at least four clips in the timeline, arranged so that there are no gaps between them. These clips will be referred to as A, B, C, D going from left to right.

  -   Clip B should be longer than clip A
  -   The start of clip B should be about trimmed 25% from the true start of the clip

3. Repeat step (2) using the start-handle of clip B.
   -   The behavior should be identical.
4. Arrange the clips so that A and B are on the same layer, while C and D are on different layers, but snapped to the end point of clip A
5. Clear the selection
6. Repeat steps (2) and (3)
   -   Only clips A and B should be affected by the roll edit

3. While holding control, click-and-drag the start handle of clip D
   -   Clips A-C should move relative to the start handle of clip D
   -   Make sure the start handle of clip D is clamped between the true start of clip D and the end handle of clip D  |

    -   Clips C, and D should now be moving with clips A and B, preserving the original offsets
13. Move the mouse as far as possible to the left
   -   It should not be possible to set the start time of clips A, B, C or D less to less than 0
   -   While ripple mode is engaged, the relative offsets of clips A, B, C, and D should remain constant              |
14. While continuing to drag, release the shift key

## Test Split

1. Start with at least one clip in thee timeline.
    -   Make sure you are somewhat familiar with it, so that you can spot problems during playback.
2. Click the razor tool
    -   a vertical trimming bar should appear across the timeline at the horizontal mouse position.
3. Click somewhere on the clip
    -   The clip should be divided into two clips at the mouse position
4. Preview the timeline
    -   Playback across the two pieces should be identical with the original clip.

10. With the trimming bar locked to the playhead, click on the clip.
    -   Make sure that the clip is split exactly at the playhead position (not at the mouse position). Zoom in, if necessary, to verify this.
11. Add several keyframe control points to an audio clip's volume curve, and adjust them so that the curve forms a distinctive pattern.
12. Split this clip
    The keyframe curve should be duplicated exactly. Verify this by extending both halves of the clip to full length and comparing the shape of the curves.
