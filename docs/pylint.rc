# lint Python modules using external checkers.
#
# This is the main checker controlling the other ones and the reports
# generation. It is itself both a raw checker and an astng checker in order
# to:
# * handle message activation / deactivation at the module level
# * handle some basic but necessary stats'data (number of classes, methods...)
#
[MASTER]

# Python code to execute, usually for sys.path manipulation such as
init-hook='import gi; gi.require_version("Gtk", "3.0"); gi.require_version("Gst", "1.0"); from gi.repository import Gst; Gst.init(None); gi.require_version("GES", "1.0"); from gi.repository import GES; GES.init()'
