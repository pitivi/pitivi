# 0.15.1 Release “Endless Excursion”

**Warning**: do not use this release, see [0.15.2](releases/0.15.2.md)
instead.

This was a special bug fix release to prevent PiTiVi from entering an
endless recursion, due to a change introduced in the GStreamer “good”
plugins. It was meant to ensure that PiTiVi keeps working with the
latest gst releases.

Translations have also been updated.

Dependencies/requirements have been unchanged since the
[0.15](releases/0.15.md) release.
