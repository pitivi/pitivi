# 0.96 Release “Cogito Ergo Proxy”

As of June 30th, 2016, the Pitivi team is proud to announce the sixth
beta release of Pitivi toward the 1.0 version.

This is considered a beta release since the “big picture” remains
“making Pitivi stable”. Note that while we use the word “beta” here,
this *is* the latest “stable” release, and is the one we recommend over
all previous ones.

Pitivi works well for us and we make nice movies with it. Try it out,
have fun and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter!
