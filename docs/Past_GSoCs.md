# Past GSoCs

See [Google Summer of Code](Google_Summer_of_Code.md) for how to
get involved.

## 2018

-   [Harish Fulara](https://harishfulara07.wordpress.com/) implemented
    a framework for showing different UI perspectives. The existing
    main UI has been refactored into the EditorPerspective, and
    the welcome dialog has been replaced by a new gorgeous and modern
    [GreeterPerspective](https://harishfulara07.wordpress.com/2018/08/13/gsoc-2018-final-report-pitivi-ui-polishing/).
-   [Suhas Nayak](https://suhas2go.github.io) finished the slow motion
    support in [GES][GES.md].
-   [Yatin Maan](https://yatinmaan.github.io/) implemented support
    for [Scaled Proxies](https://yatinmaan.github.io/2018/08/14/GSoC-18-Final-Report/).

## 2017

-   [Fabián Orccón](https://cfoch.github.io/) implemented a
    [plugin system](https://cfoch.github.io/tech/2017/08/28/wrap-up-and-code-submission.html)
    which has been merged. We noticed too late the excellent additional
    Developer Console plugin had licensing issues, and it has been
    merged one year later after Fabian graciously made time to rewrite it.
-   [Suhas Nayak](https://suhas2go.github.io) implemented a [framework for
    supporting custom UI for effects](https://suhas2go.github.io/gnome/pitivi/2017/08/28/GSoCFinalReport/),
    instead of the UI generated automatically. Suhas used the new framework to
    provide a polished UI for the `frei0r-filter-3-point-color-balance` and
    `alpha` effects.
-   [Ștefan-Adrian Popa](https://stefanpopablog.wordpress.com) implemented
    the UI for the [Ken-Burns
    effect](https://stefanpopablog.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/gsoc-2017-coming-to-an-end/),
    including keyframing the placement and zoom of the clips by interacting with
    the viewer. Additionally, Ștefan fixed a lot of bugs [most of them unrelated
    to his main
    task](https://gist.github.com/stefanzzz22/260fa2be10bccd7404af87152ecd5a88).

## 2016

-   [Jakub Brindza](https://github.com/jakubbrindza) implemented
    [customizable keyboard
    shortcuts](http://www.jakubbrindza.com/2016/08/gsoc-with-pitivi.html).

## 2014

-   [Fabián Orccón](https://cfoch.github.io/) worked on the Pitivi,
    GES, GStreamer stack to allow using image sequences.
-   [Lubosz Sarnecki](https://lubosz.wordpress.com/) worked on
    implementing a new OpenGL based transformation effect to be used for
    the transformation UI.

## 2013

-   Anton Belka worked on the initial
    implementation of proxies in [GES](GES.md) (see [proxy
    editing requirements](design/proxy_editing_requirements.md)).
-   Joris Valette started work on slow/fast-motion in GStreamer.
-   Mathieu Duponchelle worked on heavy
    bugfixing all across the Pitivi, [GES](GES.md) and GStreamer
    stack, allowing us to release [0.91](releases/0.91.md) at the end of
    the summer.
-   [Simon Corsin](https://github.com/rFlex) worked on various pieces
    alongside Mathieu, such as the new waveforms renderer.

## 2012

-   Matas Brazdeikis implemented a new UI [Test
    suite](Testing.md) using Dogtail. He also started the
    implementation of a title editing user interface.
-   Paul Lange implemented a manual layer
    controls user interface for the timeline.
-   Volodymyr Rudoy spent some time
    designing the GES “Materials” (now known as Assets) API.

All the work above has been merged and is expected to be available in
the [0.91](releases/0.91.md) release.

In addition, we also co-mentored Pēteris Krišjānis who worked on an
audio waveform generation and display library for GStreamer (see his
[post-summer
report](http://pecisk.blogspot.ca/2012/11/state-of-libwaveform-after-gsoc.html)).

## 2011

-   Feroze Naina worked on adding profiles for rendering.
-   [Lubosz Sarnecki](https://lubosz.wordpress.com/) implemented a nifty
    user interface for [resizing/cropping clips directly in the
    viewer](https://lubosz.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/making-viewer-uis-for-pitivi/).
-   Mathieu Duponchelle started to port
    PiTiVi to GES after having worked on the GES Python bindings and the
    GES Pitivi formatter.

Feroze and Lubosz's work has been merged and made available in the
[0.15](releases/0.15.md) release. Mathieu's work has also been merged, to
be part of the [0.91](releases/0.91.md) release.

## 2010

-   Thibault Saunier implemented with the
    core backend developers special effects. He also worked in close
    collaboration with nekohayo for the user
    interface and testing.

Thibault's work has been merged in September/October 2010 and is
expected to be available to users in releases &gt;0.13.5.

## 2008

-   Brandon Lewis worked on the [advanced
    timeline](http://dotsony.blogspot.ch/search?updated-min=2008-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&updated-max=2009-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&max-results=41).
-   [Sarath Lakshman](http://www.sarathlakshman.com/about/) implemented
    [webcam
    capture](http://www.sarathlakshman.com/2008/09/28/pitivi-hacks).

## 2007

-   Brandon Lewis worked on the [simple
    timeline](Google_SoC_2007_-_Simple_Timeline.md).
