# Pitivi development website

This is the documentation for **planning/contributing** to [Pitivi], the
Free and Open Source video editor based on GStreamer. If you're looking
for documentation on how to *use* Pitivi, check out our [User's Manual]
(also available directly inside the application)!

To edit the website edit the markdown files in our git repo in the
`docs/` and follow our [developer instructions].

# Contributors' documentation

See the [Developer documentation](HACKING.md)

Pitivi. Here is a small overview/some starting points taken from that
category:

-   [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) (long-term plans)
-   [Architecture](Architecture.md): where does Pitivi fit? What
    are all those components?
-   [Brainstorming](design.md) (UI mockups and “future” features only!)

See also the [Contributing](http://www.pitivi.org/?go=contributing) page
on the website (includes a “Why contribute to Pitivi?” section).

## Tools to help you get started

-   [Git](Git.md)
-   [Setup development environment](HACKING.md) (official and
    easiest way to get your testing/development environment running,
    with pre-built dependencies)

## Ways to communicate
